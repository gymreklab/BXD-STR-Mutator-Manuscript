# BXD-STR-Mutator-Manuscript

Notebooks for generating figures and results are in the `analysis/` directory.

1. `analysis/stats.sh` computes some general statistics
* Total number of TRs: 1,176,016
* Total number of STRs: 1,154,738
* Total number of VNTRs: 21,278

2. `analysis/1_denovo_strs.Rmd`

Computes statistics:
* Number of unique loci with mutations: 18,119
* Number of STRs: 18,053
* Number of VNTRs: 66
* Excess of mutations on B haplotypes: 52.5%
* Percent of mutated loci that are singletons: 57.6%

Figures:
* 1b: distribution of sizes of mutations
* 1c: Proportion new mutations by epoch
* Supp Figure 1: karyoplot with locations of new mutations
* Supp Figure 2: properties of mutations by repeat unit length
* Supp Figure 3: number of strains with new mutations per locus
